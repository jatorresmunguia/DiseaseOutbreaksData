# A global database of pandemic- and epidemic-prone disease outbreaks
## Abstract
Here can be found a new dataset of infectious disease outbreaks collected from the Disease Outbreak News and the Coronavirus Dashboard produced by the World Health Organization. The dataset contains information on 70 infectious diseases and 1951 confirmed or potential public health events occurred over the period from 1996 to December 2021 in 233 countries and territories around the world. 
Target applications of this information should focus on combining our data with other information sources to study, for instance, the link between environmental, geographic, globalization, or socio-economic factors with the exposure of countries to disease outbreaks.
